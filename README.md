# Throwaway

Quickly generate pronounceable random emails addresses to use with popular throwaway email services: [erresen.github.io/throwaway](https://erresen.github.io/throwaway/)

Currently supported services:

- mailinator.com
- maildrop.cc

## Why?

I regularly use throwaway email addresses to sign up to online services without giving away my personal information, but I don't really like spamming the keyboard to come up with random email addresses for mailinator. I also wanted to learn a bit of [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/), and this seemed like an simple small project to get my feet wet. I've written up the project [in a blog post here](https://erresen.github.io/vue/js/security/privacy/programming/2020/07/09/throwaway-email-helper.html), if you're interested.
