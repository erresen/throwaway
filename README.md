# throwaway

Quickly generate pronounceable random emails addresses to use with popular throwaway email services: [erresen.github.io/throwaway](https://erresen.github.io/throwaway/)

Currently supported services:

- mailinator.com
- maildrop.cc

## Why?

I regularly use throwaway email services to sign up to services without giving away my personal data, but I don't really like spamming the keyboard to come up with random email addresses for mailinator. I also wanted to learn a bit of [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/), and this seemed like an simple small project to get my feet wet.

## Development
